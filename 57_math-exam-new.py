# rules for naming variables:
# 1. Use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words (e.g., `max_score`, `my_max_score`).
# 2. camelCase is typically used for variable names in Python (e.g., `studentScores`, `myVariableName`).
# 3. Use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the variable (e.g., `student_scores`).
